Functions
1. Minimum of an array
Returns the smallest number in the array
2. Average of an array
Returns the average value of all elements of the array
3. Check if number is prime
Returns "true" if number is prime, and "false" if not.
4. Find n!
Using recursion for finding “n!”
5. Find n-th Fibonacci Number
Recursively calculates the Fibonacci sequence, where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
6. Exponentiation 
Computes a raised to the power of n recursively (aⁿ = a * aⁿ⁻¹).
7. Reverse 
Recursively prints the elements of an input sequence in reverse order.
8. Check if string consists of only digits
Recursively checks if all characters in the string are digits.
9. Binomial Coefficient (C(n, k))
Uses recursion to compute C(n, k) based on the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k).
10. Compute GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers recursively.
